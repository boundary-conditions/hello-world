# hello-world
My introduction to GitHub et al
I'm a 36 year old guy from Canada, living on the East Coast, but about to move back across the country to the fraser valley of BC. Ive been a chef, and a chef instructor my whole life, but I'm considering some ideas for a career change that will challenge me intellectually and help me earn a living. Ive always been interested in problem solving, communicating and working in a team. I am excited to turn over some new stones and see what lies beneath.

The first thing I have learned is how to use git to track changes to my work. In this case, I have cloned this repository to my macbook and am editing this file.

This is my second change. I deleted my first change.
